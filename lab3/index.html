	<h1> Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
	<p> The idea of this lab was to ensure the success of creating local file structures on a personal computer, and know how to add index.html files.</p>

	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>Here is the result of the index.html file I created, as well as the new file structure:</p>
