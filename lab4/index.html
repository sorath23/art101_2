<h3>Challenges, Problems, Results</h3>
The only challenge I had was wondering if I was using breaking the pseudocode into the right steps. I wasn't sure how vague we were supposed to be, or if it was supposed to go more in depth on specifics, but hopefully I did alright! Thankfully everything went well in terms of typing in the javascript file and then transferring the data using the < pre> < code> function. I think the results turned out fun, I tried expirementing with a little bit of text decoration :)
