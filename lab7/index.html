			<h1>Lab 7 Functions</h1>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p> There were no challenges, aside from linking of the javascript. Even though the code and location was right, it took a while for atom to find my file.</p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p> It seemed more like a waiting game.</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p> Everything worked after a while, didn't change the original code but just waited for almost everything to render.</p>
