      <h1> Lab 8: Anon Functions and Callbacks </h1>
      <h2> Challenges </h2>
      <p> The only problem we had was having the console find our javascript file. However, it showed up after a while.</p>
      <h3> Problems </h3>
      <p> Java script does not show up on the website immediately even when pushed to github. </p>
      <h4> Results </h4>
      <p> Go to Console to see the output! Javascript showed after a duration of time and no changes made.
			We also added a new callback function, that logs a message to the console that is there after 5 seconds.</p>
